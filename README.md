Project Terminus is a hex-based tactical RPG built in Godot.
It is a long-term learning project focused on understanding programmatic thinking, complex system design, and end-to-end software development through practical experimentation.
The primary goal is not content volume or polish, but the creation and integration of interconnected game systems that form a technically lean and playable whole.
This project is intentionally exploratory in nature and serves as a sandbox for prototyping, refactoring, and system-level learning rather than a commercial product.
