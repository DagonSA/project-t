TO DO RIGHT NOW:
	- add movement rules for eligibility of move - IN PRORGRESS:
		replace get surrounding cells with axial calculation 
		when that's done, continue with the movement rules in board manager 
	- add portal moves
	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	To REFACTOR: 
		1) Potential READY phase before Turn 1
		2) Movement phase - alternate between players
		2) Signals sending payloads instead of arguments (to bulletproof stuff)
		3) Consider lookint at all tile-related code/spawners etc and think if we can change everything 
		to godot grid-based stuff (instead of using axial math etc)
		4) Move hex math to a separate helper?
