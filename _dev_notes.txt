Movement: 
	
	draft movement intention - done 
	First steps - We need movement phase for checks - DONE
	We're checking if character can move (for now only AP related) - DONE
	
	IN PROGRESS - now on to the fun part - computing and highlighting
	
	
	
	
	
	
	To REFACTOR: 
		1) Potential READY phase before Turn 1
		2) Signals sending payloads instead of arguments (to bulletproof stuff)
